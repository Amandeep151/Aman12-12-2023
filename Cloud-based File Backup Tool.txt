Cloud-based File Backup Tool
Overview
This simple Python script automates the backup of local files to a cloud storage service. It currently supports Amazon S3, but you can extend it to other cloud storage providers.

Features
Automated Backup: Schedule the script to run at specified intervals, backing up local files to the cloud storage bucket.

Amazon S3 Support: Utilizes the boto3 library to interact with Amazon S3 for file storage.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.
Pip (Python package installer) installed.
An Amazon S3 account and a bucket for storing backups.
Installation
Clone this repository:

# AWS S3 Backup Script

This Python script automates the backup of files from a local directory to an Amazon S3 bucket using Boto3.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- AWS credentials (access key and secret key) with sufficient permissions to read from the local directory and write to the S3 bucket.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-s3-backup.git
    cd aws-s3-backup
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up AWS credentials:

   - Open the script (`backup_script.py`) in a text editor.
   - Replace the placeholder values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `BUCKET_NAME`, and `LOCAL_DIRECTORY` with your AWS credentials and local directory path.

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python backup_script.py
The script will run indefinitely, performing the backup at the specified time every day.

Configuration
Adjust the following parameters in the script according to your needs:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS access key.
AWS_SECRET_KEY: Your AWS secret key.
BUCKET_NAME: The name of your S3 bucket.
LOCAL_DIRECTORY: The local directory path to be backed up.
Schedule settings in schedule.every().day.at("12:00").do(backup). Change the time or frequency as needed.
Notes
Keep your AWS credentials secure. Avoid hardcoding them directly in the script for production use.
Review and update the schedule and paths based on your specific backup requirements.
For enhanced security, consider using environment variables or IAM roles for AWS credentials.
